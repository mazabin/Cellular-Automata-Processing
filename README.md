# Cellular-Automata-Processing
Cellular Automata in Processing with G4P library.

To run program you need to install Processing v. 3.0 or higher and install G4P library from Sketch-> Import library... -> Add library... and from the list choose G4P by Peter Lager.
If you happen to find any bug, please open an issue - I'll try to solve it as fast as I can.

Project includes five simulations:
* Automata 1D based on Wolfram Rules - WIP
* Conway's Game of Life
* Naive Seeds Growth
* Dynamic Recrystalization
* Monte Carlo Simulation

GUI allows you to set:
* number of seeds on board in %
* number of iterations for simulation
* neighborhood
  * Moore
  * Von Neumann
  * Hexagonal Left
  * Hexgonal Right
  * Hexagonal Random
  * Pentagonal Random
* seed draw method
  * Random
  * Evenly
  * Mouse Only
* simulation
